=== Summary and Info

Reference Standard M (RSM) is an implementation of the M programming language
and database, which was originally created by Ray Douglas Newman as MUMPS V1
(MV1). The name change to Reference Standard M reflects its role as a reference
implementation for the M Development Committee (MDC). With RSM we will attempt
to track and implement the latest M standard that is released by the MDC,
currently ANSI X11.1-1995. See the link:CHANGELOG.adoc[CHANGELOG] for more
information on the many changes in Reference Standard M. This software uses
link:https://semver.org/[semantic versioning].

_This is the post-relational database._

The RSM link:doc/index.adoc[documentation] is a work-in-progress.

=== Installation

RSM builds and runs on Linux x86 and x86_64 (little or big-endian), AIX (little
or big-endian), FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, MacOS X 10.4 through 11.4, in 32 and
64 bit mode (using GCC or Clang), Solaris on x86 and x86_64, the Raspberry Pi
(ARMv6 and ARMv7) running Raspbian, and Windows 10, under Cygwin and Windows
Subsystem for Linux (WSL) versions 1 and 2. It might also run on Windows 7 and
Windows XP, under Cygwin, but it has not been built or tested there recently.

Thanks to John Willis for providing access to his build farm for testing.

To build RSM, clone the RSM git repository:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://gitlab.com/Reference-Standard-M/rsm.git
----

Change to the `rsm` directory and build the `rsm` executable:

[source,bash]
----
make
----
or
[source,bash]
----
make -j
----

On FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD:

[source,bash]
----
make -f BSDmakefile
----
or
[source,bash]
----
make -j -f BSDmakefile
----

On Solaris:

[source,bash]
----
gmake
----
or
[source,bash]
----
gmake -j
----

The resulting `rsm` executable will be optimized for your system.

Install the `rsm` executable in a system location [/usr/local/bin]:

[source,bash]
----
sudo make install
----
or
[source,bash]
----
sudo make install path=<path-to-system-location>
----

Clean up the build environment after installation:

[source,bash]
----
make clean
----

Uninstall the `rsm` executable from a system location [/usr/local/bin]:

[source,bash]
----
sudo make uninstall
----
or
[source,bash]
----
sudo make uninstall path=<path-to-system-location>
----

=== Usage

NOTE: Set the environment variable `RSM_DBFILE` to the database file path to
avoid having to pass it to `rsm`

Output a short version string:

[source,bash]
----
rsm -V
----

Output a helpful options menu:

[source,bash]
----
rsm -h
----

Output a database and environment configuration:

[source,bash]
----
rsm -i tst.dat
----
or
[source,bash]
----
export RSM_DBFILE="/home/user/rsm/tst.dat"
rsm -i
----

To use RSM, create a database:

[source,bash]
----
# Optional arguments in square brackets
#  -v <volume-name>        Name of volume             (1-32 alpha characters)
#  -b <block-size>         Size of database blocks    (4-256 KiB)
#  -s <database-size>      Initial size of database   (100-2147483647 blocks)
# [-m <map-size>]          Size of map block          (0-262147 KiB)
# [-e <environment-name>]  Name of manager UCI        (1-32 alpha characters)
# [<database-file>]        Name of the database file

rsm -v TST -b 16 -s 4096 tst.dat
----
or
[source,bash]
----
export RSM_DBFILE="/home/user/rsm/tst.dat"
rsm -v TST -b 16 -s 4096
----

NOTE: In order to load the supplied M utilities, use a block size of 14 KiB or
larger

Initialize and start the environment:

[source,bash]
----
# Optional arguments in square brackets
#  -j <max-jobs>          Maximum attached jobs      (1-512 jobs)
# [-g <global-buffers>]   Size of global buffers     (1-131072 MiB)
# [-r <routine-buffers>]  Size of routine buffers    (1-4095 MiB)
# [<database-file>]       Name of the database file

rsm -j 12 tst.dat
----
or
[source,bash]
----
export RSM_DBFILE="/home/user/rsm/tst.dat"
rsm -j 12
----

On MacOS X, you might need to increase the accessible shared memory before
starting the environment, if the previous command failed. If so, as root or
using `sudo`, run the following commands, adjusted based on your system
resources:

[source,bash]
....
sudo sysctl -w kern.sysv.shmmax=536870912
sudo sysctl -w kern.sysv.shmall=131072
....

On Cygwin, you need to configure and start `cygserver` (as administrator) before
starting the RSM environment, as it provides the SysV shared memory support.

[source,bash]
----
cygserver-config
cygrunsrv -S cygserver
----

Load the M utilities:

[source,bash]
----
# Optional arguments in square brackets
# -x <M-command(s)>  String of M commands
# [<database-file>]  Name of the database file

rsm -x 'open 1:("utils.rsm":"r") use 1 read code xecute code' tst.dat
----
or
[source,bash]
----
export RSM_DBFILE="/home/user/rsm/tst.dat"
rsm -x 'open 1:("utils.rsm":"r") use 1 read code xecute code'
----

NOTE: On Solaris and Cygwin, `$horolog` is in UTC as these implementations don't
have a local time offset

Start direct mode:

[source,bash]
----
# Optional arguments in square brackets
# [-e <environment-name>]  Name of initial UCI environment
# [-x <M-command(s)>]      String of M commands to execute
# [<database-file>]        Name of the database file

rsm tst.dat
----
or
[source,bash]
----
export RSM_DBFILE="/home/user/rsm/tst.dat"
rsm
----

Run an M routine in indirect mode:

[source,bash]
----
# Start the M Command Language shell
# Optional arguments in square brackets
# -x <M-command(s)>  String of M commands
# [<database-file>]  Name of the database file

rsm -x "do ^%M" tst.dat
----
or
[source,bash]
----
export RSM_DBFILE="/home/user/rsm/tst.dat"
rsm -x "do ^%M"
----

Stop and shut down environment:

[source,bash]
----
rsm -k tst.dat
----
or
[source,bash]
----
export RSM_DBFILE="/home/user/rsm/tst.dat"
rsm -k
----

From within an RSM job:

[source,m]
----
RSM [MGR]> kill ^$job
----

If `utils.rsm` has been loaded:

[source,m]
----
RSM [MGR]> do ^SSD
----

From within the MCL shell:

[source,m]
----
MCL [MGR,TST]> shutdown
----

A previous version of RSM introduced a change from 8 character identifiers to 32
character identifiers. This necessitated a change to the database format, the
routine bytecode format, and the journal format, which required bumping the
database version from 1 to 2, the compiler version from 7 to 8, and the journal
version from 1 to 2.

The RSM runtime image will detect a database in the older format, as well as
compiled bytecode in the older format, and return an appropriate error. If you
would like to move your globals and routines from an old database to a new one,
which works with this version of RSM, please follow these database
link:doc/upgrade.adoc[upgrade] instructions, or run the
link:bin/upgrade[upgrade] script.

Enjoy!
