=== Summary and Information

Reference Standard M (RSM) is an implementation of the M programming language
and database, which implements the latest M standard that has been released by
the M Development Committee (MDC), currently ANSI/MDC X11.1-1995 (ISO/IEC
11756:1999).

RSM was originally named MUMPS V1 (MV1), and was created by Raymond Douglas
Newman. When I took over maintenance and development of MV1, I changed its name
to better reflect its use as a reference implementation for the MDC.

See the link:CHANGELOG.adoc[Changelog] for more information on the development
of Reference Standard M. This software uses link:https://semver.org/[semantic
versioning].

_This is the post-relational database._

The RSM link:doc/index.adoc[documentation] is a work-in-progress.

=== Installation

RSM builds and runs on most UNIX, and UNIX-derived platforms, running 32-bit and
64-bit processors, in little-endian and big-endian mode. The platforms that have
been tested, and/or known (or suspected) to build and run RSM, are:

* Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat, OpenSUSE, and Slackware) on i386 and x86_64
* Debian Linux on ppc64le
* Gentoo Linux on IA-64
* FreeBSD on amd64
* NetBSD on amd64
* OpenBSD on amd64
* macOS 10.4 and newer on ILP32 and LP64 Intel (Clang or GCC)
* macOS 11.0 and newer on 64-bit M1 ARMv8 (Clang or GCC)
* Solaris on i86pc
* AIX on ppc32be and ppc64be
* HP-UX on IA-64
* Windows XP, 7, and 10, under Cygwin and/or Windows Subsystem for Linux 1 and 2
* Raspberry Pi on armv6l and armv7l running Raspbian
* Mobian (Mobile Debian Linux) on aarch64

WARNING: RSM will not run on SPARC, and may not run on PA-RISC hardware, due to
memory alignment requirements

Thanks to link:https://gitlab.com/jpwillis[John Willis] for providing access to
the build farm, and to link:https://github.com/racingmars[Matthew Wilson],
Terry Wiechmann, and Flavio Fornazier for helping me with testing.

To build RSM, clone the RSM git repository:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/Reference-Standard-M/rsm.git
----

Change to the `rsm` directory and build the `rsm` executable:

[source,bash]
----
$ make
----
or
[source,bash]
----
$ make -j
----

On Solaris:

[source,bash]
----
$ gmake
----
or
[source,bash]
----
$ gmake -j
----

The resulting `rsm` executable will be optimized for your system.

Install the `rsm` executable in the default bin directory [/usr/local/bin]:

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo make install
----

Install the `rsm` executable in a different bin directory [/usr/bin]:

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo make install PREFIX=/usr
----

Clean up the build environment after installation:

[source,bash]
----
$ make clean
----

Uninstall the `rsm` executable from the default bin directory [/usr/local/bin]:

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo make uninstall
----

Uninstall the `rsm` executable from a different bin directory [/usr/bin]:

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo make uninstall PREFIX=/usr
----

=== Usage

NOTE: Set the environment variable `RSM_DBFILE` to the database file path to
avoid having to pass it to `rsm`

Output a short version string:

[source,bash]
----
$ rsm -V
----

Output a helpful options menu:

[source,bash]
----
$ rsm -h
----

To use RSM, create a database:

[source,bash]
----
# Optional arguments in square brackets
#  -v <volume-name>        Name of volume             (1-32 alpha characters)
#  -b <block-size>         Size of database blocks    (1-256 KiB)
#  -s <database-size>      Initial size of database   (100-2147483647 blocks)
# [-m <map-size>]          Size of map block          (0-262147 KiB)
# [-e <environment-name>]  Name of manager UCI        (1-32 alpha characters)
# [<database-file>]        Name of the database file

$ rsm -v TST -b 16 -s 4096 tst.dat
----
or
[source,bash]
----
$ export RSM_DBFILE="/home/user/rsm/tst.dat"
$ rsm -v TST -b 16 -s 4096
----

NOTE: In order to load the supplied M utilities, use a block size of 14 KiB or
larger

Initialize and start the environment:

[source,bash]
----
# Optional arguments in square brackets
#  -j <max-jobs>          Size of job table in environment  (1-1024 jobs)
# [-g <global-buffers>]   Size of global buffers            (1-131072 MiB)
# [-r <routine-buffers>]  Size of routine buffers           (1-4095 MiB)
# [<database-file>]       Name of the database file

$ rsm -j 12 tst.dat
----
or
[source,bash]
----
$ export RSM_DBFILE="/home/user/rsm/tst.dat"
$ rsm -j 12
----

On macOS, you might need to increase the accessible shared memory before
starting the environment, if the previous command failed. If so, as root or
using `sudo`, run the following commands, adjusted based on your system
resources:

[source,bash]
----
# 2 GiB shared segment max:
$ sudo sysctl -w kern.sysv.shmmax=2147483648

# 8 GiB of system shared memory (in number of pages at 4096 bytes per page):
$ sudo sysctl -w kern.sysv.shmall=2097152
----

On Cygwin, you need to configure and start `cygserver` (as administrator) before
starting the RSM environment, as it provides the SysV shared memory support.

[source,bash]
----
$ cygserver-config
$ cygrunsrv -S cygserver
----

Output a database and environment configuration:

[source,bash]
----
$ rsm -i tst.dat
----
or
[source,bash]
----
$ export RSM_DBFILE="/home/user/rsm/tst.dat"
$ rsm -i
----

Load the M utilities (using the bootstrap method):

[source,bash]
----
# Optional arguments in square brackets
# -x <M-command(s)>        String of M commands to execute
# [-e <environment-name>]  Name of initial UCI environment
# [<database-file>]        Name of the database file

$ rsm -x 'open 1:("utils.rsm":"read") use 1 read code xecute code' tst.dat
----
or
[source,bash]
----
$ export RSM_DBFILE="/home/user/rsm/tst.dat"
$ rsm -x 'open 1:("utils.rsm":"read") use 1 read code xecute code'
----

Start direct mode:

[source,bash]
----
# Optional arguments in square brackets
# [-e <environment-name>]  Name of initial UCI environment
# [-R]                     Starts in restricted mode
# [<database-file>]        Name of the database file

$ rsm tst.dat
----
or
[source,bash]
----
$ export RSM_DBFILE="/home/user/rsm/tst.dat"
$ rsm
----

Run an M routine in indirect mode:

[source,bash]
----
# Start the M Command Language shell
# Optional arguments in square brackets
# -x <M-command(s)>        String of M commands to execute
# [-e <environment-name>]  Name of initial UCI environment
# [-R]                     Starts in restricted mode
# [<database-file>]        Name of the database file

$ rsm -x "do ^%M" tst.dat
----
or
[source,bash]
----
$ export RSM_DBFILE="/home/user/rsm/tst.dat"
$ rsm -x "do ^%M"
----

When upgrading to a new version of RSM, you might occasionally run in to an
issue executing a routine. Normally this will not be an issue, but if it is, you
can fix it by recompiling the routines:

[source,cos]
----
RSM [MGR,TST]> merge ^$routine("%RECOMP")=^$routine("%RECOMP")
RSM [MGR,TST]> do ^%RECOMP
----

Stop and shut down environment:

[source,bash]
----
$ rsm -k tst.dat
----
or
[source,bash]
----
$ export RSM_DBFILE="/home/user/rsm/tst.dat"
$ rsm -k
----

From within an RSM job:

[source,cos]
----
RSM [MGR,TST]> kill ^$job
----

If `utils.rsm` has been loaded:

[source,cos]
----
RSM [MGR,TST]> do ^SSD
----

From within the MCL shell:

[source,cos]
----
MCL [MGR,TST]> shutdown
----

=== Docker Container

To download the latest RSM Docker image from Docker Hub:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker pull dlwicksell/rsm
----

To build the RSM Docker image from source, while in the `rsm` directory:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker build -t rsm .
----
or
[source,bash]
----
$ docker buildx build -t rsm .
----

You can change a few build parameters, by passing them as follows:

[source,bash]
----
# Pass each build argument with a separate --build-arg  - as below
# journal=on       Turns journaling on in the image     - defaults to off
# bsize=<bsize>    The size of a database block in KiB  - defaults to 16
# blocks=<blocks>  The number of blocks in the database - defaults to 16384

$ docker build -t rsm \
      --build-arg journal=on \
      --build-arg bsize=32 \
      --build-arg blocks=32768 .
----
or
[source,bash]
----
$ docker buildx build -t rsm \
      --build-arg journal=on \
      --build-arg bsize=32 \
      --build-arg blocks=32768 .
----

NOTE: If you build the image from source, using the previous example, replace
dlwicksell/rsm with rsm below

To create and run the Docker container with RSM in direct mode:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker run -it --rm --name rsm dlwicksell/rsm
----
or
[source,bash]
----
$ docker run -it --name rsm dlwicksell/rsm
----

To create and run it in detached mode:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker run -itd --name rsm dlwicksell/rsm
----

The RSM Docker container runs with port 80 open. To map an open port on your
host machine to the container port (replace 8080 with an available local port):

[source,bash]
----
$ docker run -itd --name rsm -p 8080:80 dlwicksell/rsm
----

You can change a few runtime parameters, by passing them as follows:

[source,bash]
----
# The first argument [32|2] will set the number of maximum RSM jobs - default 12
# The second argument ['write...'] will run that M code and remove the container

$ docker run -it --rm --name rsm dlwicksell/rsm 32
$ docker run -it --rm --name rsm dlwicksell/rsm 2 'write $system,!'
----

To run RSM in direct mode while the container is in detached mode:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker exec -it rsm rsm
----

To run RSM commands while the container is in detached mode:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker exec -it rsm rsm -i
$ docker exec -it rsm rsm -h
$ docker exec -it rsm rsm -V
$ docker exec -it rsm rsm -x 'write $system,!'
----

To run the Bash shell while the container is in detached mode:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker exec -it rsm bash
----

To start the container while in detached mode:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker start rsm
----

To stop the container while in detached mode:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker stop rsm
----

Consult the Docker link:https://docs.docker.com/[documentation] to learn about
other ways you can run and manage the RSM Docker image and container.

=== Database Upgrade

Version 1.73.0 of RSM introduced a change from 8 character identifiers to 32
character identifiers. This necessitated a change to the database format, the
routine bytecode format, and the journal format, which required bumping the
database version from 1 to 2, the compiler version from 7 to 8, and the journal
version from 1 to 2.

The RSM runtime image will detect a database in the older format, as well as
compiled bytecode in the older format, and return an appropriate error. If you
would like to move your globals and routines from an old database to a new one,
which works with this version of RSM, please follow these database
link:doc/upgrade.adoc[upgrade] instructions, or run the
link:bin/upgrade[upgrade] script.

Enjoy!
