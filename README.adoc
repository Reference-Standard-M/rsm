==== Summary and Info

Reference Standard M (RSM) is the new name of the MUMPS V1 (MV1) implementation
of M, originally developed by Ray Douglas Newman. Ray gave me permission to take
over as the official developer and maintainer of Mumps V1, as well as permission
to change the licensing of the code base, in July of 2020. The initial release
of RSM is based on the last released version of MUMPS V1, version 1.71, and
includes a number of quality-of-life improvements. Reference Standard M will
attempt to track and implement the latest M standard that is released by the M
Development Committee (MDC), currently ANSI X11.1-1995. This software uses

==== Installation

This version of RSM runs on Linux x86 and x86_64, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD,
MacOS X 10.4 through 10.15 in 32 and 64 bit mode, Solaris on x86 and x86_64, and
the Raspberry Pi [ARMv6 and ARMv7] running Raspbian (for embedded RSM). This
version might also run on Windows XP, Windows 7, and Windows 10 under Cygwin,
but it has not been built or tested there recently.

Thanks to John Willis for helping me test the FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, MacOS X,
Solaris, and Raspberry Pi ports.

To build RSM, first clone the RSM git repository (the latest):

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://gitlab.com/Reference-Standard-M/rsm.git
----

Then change to the `rsm` directory and build the RSM executable:

[source,bash]
----
make
----

On FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD:

[source,bash]
----
make -f BSDmakefile
----

On Solaris:

[source,bash]
----
gmake
----

The resulting `rsm` executable will be optimized for your system.

==== Usage

To use RSM, first create a database:

[source,bash]
----
# -v <volume set name [1-8 characters]>
# -b <block size in KiB [4-256 KiB]>
# -s <number of blocks [100-2147483647]>
# <database file name>
./rsm -v TEST -b 32 -s 2000 testdb
----

NOTE: In order to load the supplied M utilities, use a block size of 32 or
larger

Then start the environment:

[source,bash]
----
# -j <max number of concurrent jobs [1-256]>
# <database file name>
./rsm -j 12 testdb
----

On MacOS X, you might need to increase the accessible shared memory before
starting the environment, if the previous command failed. If so, as root, run
the following commands:

....
sysctl -w kern.sysv.shmmax=536870912
sysctl -w kern.sysv.shmall=131072
....

Then load the M utilities:

[source,bash]
----
# -x <M code to execute>
# <database file name>
./rsm -x 'open 1:("utils.rsm":"r") use 1 read code xecute code' testdb
----

NOTE: On Solaris and Cygwin, $horolog is in GMT as these implementations don't
have a local time offset

To start direct mode:

[source,bash]
----
# <database file name>
./rsm testdb
----

To run an M routine:

[source,bash]
----
# -x <M code to execute>
# <database file name>
# start the M Command Language shell
./rsm -x "do ^%M" testdb
----

Remember to shut it down when you are done to free the shared memory:

[source,m]
----
RSM> kill ^$job
----

Or if `utils.rsm` has been loaded:

[source,m]
----
MCL> do ^SSD
----

Enjoy!
