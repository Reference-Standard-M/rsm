 * Extended Summary:
 *
 * This module implements the following sequential input/output (i.e., IO)
 * operations for named pipes (or FIFO):
 *
 *     SQ_Pipe_Open  - Opens FIFO for reading or writing
 *     SQ_Pipe_Write - Writes to FIFO
 *     SQ_Pipe_Read  - Reads from FIFO
 *     SQ_Pipe_Close - Closes (and/or removes) FIFO
