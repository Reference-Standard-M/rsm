=== Summary

The RSM web server is distributed as part of the vendor utilities. There are
three routines that implement the web server, which uses the HTTP protocol:

* `^%WWW`  -> Main server loop
* `^%WWW1` -> Server subroutines
* `^%WWWU` -> Server utilities

To start the web server, as root, run `job ^%WWW` or `do ^%WWW`, which listens
on port 80, and allows 5 simultaneous client requests by passing them to child
jobs for processing and to return responses to the client. You can also start
the web server as a regular user, by passing a non-privileged port (one between
1024 and 65535), via `job START^%WWW(<port>,<jobs>,<restricted>)`, or
`do START^%WWW(<port>,<jobs>,<restricted>)`, or as root, by passing any port.
Passing a second argument with a positive number will change how many
simultaneous client requests the web server can support. Keep in mind that each
client request will consume a job in the RSM job table, while it's running.
Passing a true truth-value as the third argument, turns on restricted mode,
which prevents use of the web interface to the MCL shell described below.

All documents accessible by the server are stored in the `^%D` global, with the
following format:

[source,cos]
----
^%D(<index>,0)=<name>
^%D(<index>,<version>,<line>)=<data>
^%D(<name>)=<index>
----

When requesting a resource from the web server, the supported file extensions
are interpreted as follows:

[%autowidth]
.Web Server Resources
|===
| File extension     | Description

| `js` or `JS`       | A JavaScript source file
| `css` or `CSS`     | A CSS style sheet
| `jpg` or `JPG`     | A JPEG image
| `png` or `PNG`     | A PNG image
| `gif` or `GIF`     | A GIF image
| `class` or `CLASS` | A Java class
| Anything else      | An HTML document
|===

Documents may be created and edited using `^%DED` or the `MCL` commands
`DCHANGE` and `DSCAN`. A directory of current documents may be obtained using
`^%DD` or the `MCL` command `DDIRECT`. Also `%WWWU` may be used as a front end
to the data in `^%D`, providing the following interface:

----
1. Edit a document
2. List documents
3. Delete a document
4. Import a document
----

The web server expects HTTP commands like:

[source,http]
----
GET /filename.html HTTP/1.1
GET /?$$extrinsic&field=data HTTP/1.1
----

To get a trace dump of incoming data, `set ^WWW=1` - the trace is saved in
`^WWW(<number>)=<data>`.

To log connections `set ^WWWLOG=1`.

For the filename case, the default name is `index.html`. Any directory specified
is ignored (e.g., /dir/file -> file).

For the extrinsic case, two arguments are passed by-reference. The first is an
array of the data exactly as received from the client (browser). The second is
an array of the form `(<field>)=<data>` where the `%nn` values have been
resolved.

If the return value is not null, it is displayed as an error message.

If the value of the top node of the first argument is not null, it is treated as
a document to retrieve.

The extrinsic may write data directly to the browser as the socket channel [10]
is current when the extrinsic is accessed. There is no need for the extrinsic to
return in this case, it may just halt.

There is an extrinsic interface to the MCL, which could be added to a document:

[source,html]
----
<a href="?$$WWW^%25M&CMD=SHOW%20SYSTEM">Click here for SHOW SYSTEM</a>
----

This will give some system info - note the 25 after the % is required as % is
used as an escape character by HTTP.
