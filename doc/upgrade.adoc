=== Database Upgrade Instructions

RSM version 1.73.0 introduced some changes to the format of both the database
and the routine bytecode. These changes were required to support the change to
32 character names that were added throughout RSM.

However, you can compile RSM version 1.73.0 (or later) with the `dbver=1` flag
and the resulting runtime image will work with the older database and bytecode
formats, which used 8 character names. This will allow you to effectively
upgrade an older RSM or MV1 database, to the new RSM database format, by
connecting to an older database, and exporting all the routines and globals you
wish to move to your new RSM database.

There is an link:../bin/upgrade[upgrade] script that you can run to automate
this process. It attempts to transfer every routine and global from every UCI,
as well as setting up and configuring your new database to match your old
database.

If you wish to do this process manually, follow the steps outlined in this
document. This example process will upgrade '`old-database.dat`' to
'`new-database.dat`', and assumes the old database environment has been shut
down. In order to use this process, you must load the routines in `utils.rsm`
in both the old and new databases, in order to run the export and import
routines. See the link:../README.adoc[README] file for more information.

Build RSM for database version 1, and then start the old database environment in
single user mode:

[source,bash]
----
make clean && make dbver=1
./rsm -j 1 old-database.dat
./rsm old-database.dat
----

Export the routines and globals from the manager UCI that you wish to move to
the new database:

[source,cos]
----

%AUTH     %C        %UTILITY  FOR       OVR       SET       UTILITY
RSM [MGR]> halt
----

Do the same process for every other UCI that has routines and globals that you
wish to move to the new database, taking care to name the routine and global out
files according to their UCI, so you can import them in to the correct
environment in the new database. In this example, we'll assume there is one more
UCI we care about named `USR`. After exporting the last of the routines and
globals that we want to move to the new database, shut down the old environment:

[source,cos]
----
RSM [MGR]> do ^%RS

Routine(s): *
Filename:   usr.ro
Header Txt: RSM USR routines
GETDOCS   PATINFO   NAMEINFO
RSM [MGR]> do ^%GS

Global(s):  *
Filename:   usr.go
Header Txt: RSM USR globals
TST       PATIENTS  XVEMS     UTILITY
RSM [MGR]> kill ^$job
----

Compile RSM without the `dbver` flag, using the latest build, with database
version 2. Create a new database and start the new environment in single user
mode. For this example, we'll assume the new database volume will be named
`TST`. See the link:../README.adoc[README] file for more information about
creating a new RSM database and environment:

[source,bash]
----
make clean && make
./rsm -v TST -b 16 -s 4096 new-database.dat
./rsm -j 1 new-database.dat
----

Load the new vendor utility routines, so that you have the import routines
available, and start an RSM job:

[source,bash]
----
./rsm -x 'open 1:("utils.rsm":"r") use 1 read code xecute code' new-database.dat
./rsm new-database.dat
----

Import the routines and globals you exported from the older database and shut
down the environment:

[source,cos]
